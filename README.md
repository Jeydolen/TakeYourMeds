# Take your meds
An app that aim to help people to take their medicine.

This is a free open source project. You are welcome to contribute and make pull request.

I'm (@Jeydolen) not really experienced with github open source projects so I won't be mad if you tell me how to do things better.

## Features
Take your meds currently provide:
* Addition of medication (could be anything actually even water) with custom notes.
* Mood tracker (you can view it day per day in your expanded summary).
* Notifications system to be reminded to take medication.
* Export and share of data in JSON and CSV.
